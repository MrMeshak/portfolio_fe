Hello! Welcome to my portfolio. I'm Meshak, a passionate programmer and web developer with a strong drive to solve real-world problems using code. This portfolio showcases my journey, projects and skills.

## About Me

I found my love for coding when my brother started studying web development. I was captivated by the creativity, innovation, and rapid feedback of web development, leading me to quit my job and pursue it full-time. I thoroughly enjoy learning the latest technologies and using them to create a variety of projects, which you can explore in this portfolio.
